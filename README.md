# üß† Health Risk Predictor API

An API built with **FastAPI** to simulate early risk prediction of lung cancer based on multiple factors such as age, smoking history, pollution exposure, and genetic predisposition.

This project was developed as a practical backend training aligned with real-world health AI use cases.
